# JavaScript Algorithm Problems

## This Project

I want to improve my performance in technical interviews. Thus I'm creating this "Blog" to track, a problem I work on each day. The language  chosen for this is JavaScript. JavaScript being one of the most popular programming languages and generally one of the first languages a developer learns. I hope this "blog" also helps others solve problems.

The questions come from a variety of places arcoss the internet and books.

## Reverse a String
Given a string value, the program must return the reverse of the string.

I have only provided one solution to this problem. It used the built in functions of split(), reverse(), and join().

## Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

No solution has current been given by me.

## Determine if String has all unique characters
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What
if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Reverse the vowels in a String

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

Example 1:
Given s = "hello", return "holle".

Example 2:
Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede".

Note:
The vowels does not include the letter "y".

No current solution given by me.

## Find the Longest Word in a String
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.

Your response should be a number.

Note:
Currently have one solution it use the sort() method.

## Linked List
This series will go through the basic creation of a
linked list, the different types and problems are asked for linked list.

## Stacks and Queues
Similar format to linked lists.

## Implement a Stack Using Queues
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.

Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.

You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
